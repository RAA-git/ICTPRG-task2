Creating a practice enrollment python program
Create an application that allows a user to “enroll” in an IT course.  

The user must first choose the courses they have already completed. 
The user then may only choose a course where they meet the “Prerequisite”.  
After the user selects the appropriate course, an enrolment confirmation message must be shown to the user. (The application does NOT need to enroll a user!)  

See below for the courses and prerequisites. 

Course                                   Prerequisite 

Certificate II in IT                      None 
Certificate III in IT - Programming       Certificate II in IT 
Certificate III in IT – Networking        Certificate II in IT 
Certificate IV in IT - Programming        Certificate III in IT - Programming 
Certificate IV in IT – Networking         Certificate III in IT – Networking 
Diploma in IT                             Certificate IV in IT - Programming  OR  Certificate IV in IT – Networking 

 My issue is everything is ok except for the selection in the Diploma, selecting either course in the prerequisite will not bring up the option for selecting the Diploma to enroll in.
